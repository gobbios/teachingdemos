This little survey tests the perception of visual information based on different types of graphical elements. You will see different types of plots with two focus elements, named *A* and *B*. These could be 

  - lines of different angles
  
  - lines of different lengths
  
  - bars of different height 
  
  - shapes of different sizes
  
  - circles of different colours
  
  - circles placed along a vertical axis

The first question to answer is which of the two elements represents the smaller value. Select your answer and press `Continue`. 

The second question asks you to estimate the difference between the two elements. For example, if you estimate element `A` to represent 95 and element `B` to be 81, then the difference is 14. Please use a positive number here, i.e. the difference would be 14 for A=95 and B=81 and also 14 for A=81 and B=95.

Note that the type of scale provided differs between the different types of graphs. For the bars and circles, you'll see an ordinary y-axis with limits of 0 and 100. For the shape- and colour-trials, you'll see a scale provided at the top of the chart. For angles, you'll see a small legend.
