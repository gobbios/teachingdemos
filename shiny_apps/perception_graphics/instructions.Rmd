This little survey tests the perception of visual information based on different types of graphical elements. You will see different types of plots with two focus elements, named *A* and *B*. These could be 

  - lines of different angles
  
  - bars of different height 
  
  - shapes of different sizes
  
  - circles of different colours

The first question to answer is which of the two is smaller. The second question asks you to estimate what percentage the smaller element is compared to the larger.

Note that the type of scale provided differs between the different types. For the bars, you'll see an ordinary y-axis with limits of 0 and 100. For the shape- and colour-trials, you'll see a scale provided at the top of the chart.
